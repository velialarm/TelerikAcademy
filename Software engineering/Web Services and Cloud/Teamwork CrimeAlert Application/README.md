# Web Services and Cloud Technologies #

## Project Description ##
Design and implement a RESTful API, host it in the cloud and develop a client application.

## General Requirements ##

**Please define and implement the following assets in your project:**
### Requirements for the RESTful API ###
* 	Use ASP.NET WebAPI - *Your application must be implemented using ASP.NET WebAPI*
* 	Provide a RESTful API - *The endpoints should provide CRUD operations: POST, GET, PUT and DELETE*
* 	Host the application in the cloud - *Use AppHarbor*
* 	Use a file storage cloud API - *Dropbox, Google Drive or other*
* 	Use a cloud database - *MS SQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis or other*
* 	Implement notifications functionality - *Use PubNub or other* 

### Requirements for the Client application ###
*	The client application can be one of the following:
*	Web SPA application using JavaScript
*	iOS mobile application
*	Android mobile application
*	Windows 8/Windows Phone 8 mobile application
*	Cross-platform mobile application using Apache Cordova, Xamarin or other
*	Windows desktop application using WPF, Windows Forms or the console
*	The client application must send HTTP requests to the RESTful API

## Additional Requirements ##
*	Follow the best practices for OO design: use data encapsulation, use exception handling properly, use inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism properly and follow the principles of strong cohesion and loose coupling
*	Create a solid validation on both the Web services application and on the client application
*	Use a source control system by choice

## Optional Requirements ##
If you have a chance, time and a suitable situation, you might add some of the following to your project:
*	Usage of message queues
*	Unit and/or integration testing

## Deliverables ##
Put the following in a ZIP archive and submit it (each team member submits the same file):
*	The complete source code
*	Add webservices.teamwork@gmail.com as a collaborator to your project in AppHarbor
*	Brief documentation of your project (2-3 pages). It should provide the following information (in brief):
*	Team name and list of team members
*	Project purpose â€“ what problem do you solve?
*	Class diagram of your types
*	The URL of your source control repository
*	Any other information (optionally)
*	Optionally provide a PowerPoint presentation designed for the project defense

## Public Project Defense ##
Each team will have to deliver a public defense of its work to the other students and trainers. You will have only 5 minutes for the following:
*	Demonstrate the application (very shortly)
*	Show the class diagram (just a glance)
*	Show the source code in the source control system code browser
*	Show the commits logs to confirm that team member have contributed
*	Optionally you might prepare a PowerPoint presentation (3-4 slides)
Please be strict in timing! Be well prepared for presenting maximum of your work for minimum time. Bring your own laptop. Test it preliminary with the multimedia projector. Open the project assets beforehand to save time. You have 5 minutes, no more.

## Give Feedback about Your Teammates ##
You will be invited to provide feedback about all your teammates, their attitude to this project, their technical skills, their team working skills, their contribution to the project, etc. The feedback is important part of the project evaluation so take it seriously and be honest.
