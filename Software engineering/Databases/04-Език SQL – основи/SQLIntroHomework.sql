-- 1. What is SQL? What is DML? What is DDL? Recite the most important SQL commands.
	--  What is SQL? - The Structured Query Language (SQL) is the set of instructions used to interact with a relational database. In fact, SQL is the only language that most databases actually understand. Whenever you interact with such a database, the software translates your commands (whether they are mouse clicks or form entries) into SQL statement that the database knows how to interpret. 
	--  What is DDL? - A data manipulation language (DML) is a family of syntax elements similar to a computer programming language used for selecting, inserting, deleting and updating data in a database. Performing read-only queries of data is sometimes also considered a component of DML.
	--  Most important SQL commands are SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. What is Transact-SQL (T-SQL)?
	-- Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to SQL. SQL, the acronym for Structured Query Language, is a standardized computer language that was originally developed by IBM for querying, altering and defining relational databases, using declarative statements. T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE and UPDATE statements.

-- 4. Write a SQL query to find all information about all departments (use "TelerikAcademy" database).

select 
	d.Name as DepartmentName,
	e.FirstName +' '+e.LastName as ManagerName 
from Departments as d
inner join Employees as e on e.ManagerID = d.ManagerID
order by d.Name;
